# Decision Tree for Spotify data.

The code in this repository implements a Decision Tree classifier trained on spotify_data.csv. In this dataset, an individual has generated a list of songs, each with a set of features and whether the individual liked or disliked the song. The goal of this classifier is to predict whether this individual would like or dislike a song based on a list of features.
